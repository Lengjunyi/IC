## ClassScheduling
> For the rising Junior, the school has opened up 11 AP courses, which would be divided to be held in 4 different periods. Since each individual is only able to take one course at a time (unless you have Hermione's magic watch), some courses are to be in conflict with other ones. Then it is your job to find a way to divide up the 11 courses up so that most people would be able to satisfy their own needs. Suppose we have the data for all students' course, how shall you give a good way to divide them up?
